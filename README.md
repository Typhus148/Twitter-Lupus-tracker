# Twitter-Lupus-tracker
I am tracking tweets related to lupus to see how big of a community this disease has and how active the lupus community is on twitter.

Work in Progress:
Currently working on graphing tweets from the twitter streaming api by frequency per day and location within the USA for a set time frame.
